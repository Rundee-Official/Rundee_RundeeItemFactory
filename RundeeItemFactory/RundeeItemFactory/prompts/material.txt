{ITEM_TYPE} Generation - Preset: {PRESET_NAME}

{PRESET_CONTEXT}

Task:
Generate {COUNT} crafting materials and junk items for this survival setting.
{EXCLUDE_IDS}

Item type guidelines:
- These items are used for crafting, building, or scrapping.
- Do NOT create food, drink, weapons, or medicine in this preset.
- Focus on materials like wood planks, scrap metal, nails, screws, springs, electronic boards, wires, cloth, etc.

Use this JSON schema EXACTLY for each item:
{
  "id": string (unique, lowercase, underscore),
  "displayName": string,

  "category": "Material" | "Junk" | "Component",
  "rarity": "Common" | "Uncommon" | "Rare",
  "maxStack": integer,

  "materialType": "Wood" | "Metal" | "Plastic" | "Fabric" | "Glass" | "Electronic" | "Stone" | "Rubber",

  "hardness": integer,      // 0-100, structural strength
  "flammability": integer,  // 0-100, how well it burns
  "value": integer,         // 0-100, scrap/trade value

  "description": string
}

Balancing rules:
- Common items: low to medium value (value 5-40), simple materials.
- Uncommon items: better structural stats or higher value (value 25-70).
- Rare items: high value or very useful components (value 50-100).
- hardness, flammability, and value must all be in the range 0-100.
- maxStack should be between 1 and 100.
- description must NOT be empty and should be 1 short sentence (5-20 words)
  that explains what the item looks like and how it is used.

Output:
- Output ONLY a JSON array of items.
- No comments, no extra text, no Markdown, no explanation.
