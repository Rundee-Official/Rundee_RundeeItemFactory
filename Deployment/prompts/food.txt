{ITEM_TYPE} Generation - Preset: {PRESET_NAME}

Model: {MODEL_NAME}
Run started: {TIMESTAMP}
Current existing items in this category: {EXISTING_COUNT}

{PRESET_CONTEXT}
The player has:
- maxHunger = {MAX_HUNGER}
- maxThirst = {MAX_THIRST}

Task:
Generate {COUNT} food-related items for an early-game survival setting.
{EXCLUDE_IDS}

Rules:
- Use this JSON schema EXACTLY for each item:
{
  "id": string (unique, lowercase, underscore),
  "displayName": string,
  "category": "Food",
  "rarity": "Common" | "Uncommon" | "Rare",
  "maxStack": integer,

  "hungerRestore": integer,
  "thirstRestore": integer,
  "healthRestore": integer,

  "spoils": boolean,
  "spoilTimeMinutes": integer,

  "description": string
}

IMPORTANT:
- category MUST be "Food" (NOT "Drink").
- Generate ONLY food items, not drinks.
- description must NOT be empty and should be 1 short sentence (5-20 words)
  that describes what the food looks like and its taste.

Balancing:
- Snacks: hungerRestore 5-15, thirstRestore 0-5
- Light meals: hungerRestore 15-30, thirstRestore 0-10
- Heavy meals: hungerRestore 30-50, thirstRestore 0-10
- All values must be between 0 and 100.
- Use only integers for all restore values.

Spoilage rules:
- If spoils is true, spoilTimeMinutes must be at least 60 (1 hour minimum)
- Common perishable food: spoilTimeMinutes 60-240 (1-4 hours)
- Uncommon perishable food: spoilTimeMinutes 240-720 (4-12 hours)
- Rare perishable food: spoilTimeMinutes 720-1440 (12-24 hours)
- Non-perishable food (spoils = false) should not have spoilTimeMinutes set
- Very short spoil times (< 60 minutes) are unrealistic and should be avoided

Output:
- Output ONLY a JSON array of items.
- No comments, no extra text, no Markdown, no explanation.
