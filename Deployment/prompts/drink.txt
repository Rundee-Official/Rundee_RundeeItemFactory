{ITEM_TYPE} Generation - Preset: {PRESET_NAME}

Model: {MODEL_NAME}
Run started: {TIMESTAMP}
Current existing items in this category: {EXISTING_COUNT}

{PRESET_CONTEXT}
The player has:
- maxHunger = {MAX_HUNGER}
- maxThirst = {MAX_THIRST}

Task:
Generate {COUNT} drink-related items for an early-game survival setting.
{EXCLUDE_IDS}

Rules:
- Use this JSON schema EXACTLY for each item:
{
  "id": string (unique, lowercase, underscore),
  "displayName": string,
  "category": "Drink",
  "rarity": "Common" | "Uncommon" | "Rare",
  "maxStack": integer,

  "hungerRestore": integer,
  "thirstRestore": integer,
  "healthRestore": integer,

  "spoils": boolean,
  "spoilTimeMinutes": integer,

  "description": string
}

IMPORTANT:
- category MUST be "Drink" (NOT "Food").
- Generate ONLY drink items, not food.
- description must NOT be empty and should be 1 short sentence (5-20 words)
  that describes what the drink looks like and its taste.

Balancing:
- Refreshing drinks: hungerRestore 0-5, thirstRestore 15-30
- Energy drinks / tonics: hungerRestore 0-10, thirstRestore 25-45, healthRestore 5-15
- All values must be between 0 and 100.
- Use only integers for all restore values.
- thirstRestore should be higher than hungerRestore for drinks.
- Total restore value (hungerRestore + thirstRestore + healthRestore) should be reasonable:
  * Common drinks: total 15-35
  * Uncommon drinks: total 30-60
  * Rare drinks: total 50-100
- Avoid creating drinks with extremely high total restore values (>100) as they break game balance.

Output:
- Output ONLY a JSON array of items.
- No comments, no extra text, no Markdown, no explanation.
